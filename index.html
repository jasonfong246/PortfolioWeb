                    <p>
                        Hello there! My name is Jason Shen Yik Fong, and I’m from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I began my
                        studies at Sunway University(Malaysia) from 2018 to 2020, majoring in Computer Science for the
                        American Degree Transfer Program, and I was excited to continue my education in the U.S.
                        However, when COVID hit in 2020, I started my first online classes at Ohio State University
                        (OSU) in Autumn 2020. Once travel became possible, I flew to OSU in Autumn 2021, where I studied
                        for three years while working as a part-time Student Assistant and eventually becoming a Student
                        Manager before graduation. During this time, I also built lasting friendships that became like
                        family, supporting me throughout my studies and beyond.

            <img src="images/EndlessRunner.gif" class="modal-img">
            <p>This Endless Runner game, inspired by Subway Surfers and Temple Run, was developed by a two-person team using Unity, C# scripting, and the Unity Input System for precise player movement control. The player automatically advances through an endless environment while avoiding obstacles that spawn in randomized lanes (left, middle, or right) to ensure fast-paced and unpredictable gameplay.

The game includes a dynamic difficulty system where the player’s running speed gradually increases over time, creating a more challenging experience as the run progresses. To maintain performance, objects that the player has passed are efficiently removed from the scene, preventing unnecessary memory buildup and ensuring smooth gameplay.
This project showcases our understanding of Unity’s component-based architecture, object pooling, event-driven movement controls, and real-time procedural obstacle generation.</p>

            <p>Eat Together is an Android application developed using Android Studio and tested via its built-in emulator. The app is designed specifically for students looking to meet friends and socialize on campus.

Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) plans for campus activities or meals, with all data, including user accounts and plans, stored securely in Firebase. The app allows users to see who is interested in the plans they create and update their own participation status at any time, fostering real-time collaboration and social interaction.

This project demonstrates practical experience with mobile app development, Firebase integration, and user-centric interface design, as well as building systems that manage dynamic user data efficiently..</p>

        <h2>Prey & Predator Simulation</h2>
        <p>This project simulates the dynamic interaction between prey (blue) and predators (red), each with their
            own movement patterns and vision logic, similar to how real animals like birds and cats perceive their
            environment. The prey attempts to navigate the map while avoiding obstacles, including a moving pillar
            that blocks escape paths.</p>

        <p>Predators roam freely until they collide with a wall, at which point they change direction. When a prey
            enters a predator’s field of vision, the predator will actively chase it until it moves out of sight.
            The behavior is controlled through custom C# scripts in Unity, implementing AI states, detection ranges,
            and real-time decision-making.</p>

            <img src="images/GameOfSet.gif" class="modal-img">
            <p>The Game of Set is a fast-paced pattern-matching card game where each card contains a unique combination of four attributes; number, shape, color, and shading. A “Set” is formed when, for every attribute, the three selected cards are either all the same or all different.
I built the full game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including card rendering, board layout, and interactive UI elements for card selection. The JavaScript logic handles real-time pattern validation, checking whether the chosen cards satisfy Set rules using attribute comparison functions. The project also includes automatic Set generation, deck shuffling, and a dynamic UI that highlights matches, handles invalid selections, and updates the board seamlessly. The result is a complete, functioning browser version of the classic Set game with clean design, responsive interactions, and accurate rule enforcement.</p>

            <p>The Maze Generator is an interactive Unity game that creates randomized mazes each time it runs, providing a fresh challenge for players with every playthrough. Players navigate the maze to collect coins and earn points, adding an extra layer of engagement and replayability.

The maze generation algorithm uses Kruskal’s algorithm to build the structure and generate dead-ends, ensuring a unique layout every time. The project also includes visualization of the maze generation process, giving players a dynamic view of the maze as it is created.

Developed with Unity and scripted in C#, this project highlights skills in algorithm implementation, procedural content generation, game mechanics, and real-time visualization, while delivering an interactive and engaging gameplay experience.</p>
